# Write a Python program which accepts the radius of a circle from the user and compute the area

# print("Compute The Area")
# rd = int(input("Enter Circle's Radius :"))
# rad = rd*rd*3.142
# print(rad)

# Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. 
# Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.

# name = str(input("Enter Your Name :"))
# age = int(input("Enter Your Age :"))
# age1 = 100-age
# print("{} year that you will turn 100 yrs old".format(age1))


# Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd,
# print out an appropriate message to the user.

# Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game.
# Create a variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.
# •	Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is,
# print a message that the player just earned 5 points.
# •	Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails.
#  (The version that fails will have no output.)

# alien_color = "green"
# alien_color = "yellow"
# alien_color = "red"
# if alien_color == "green":
#     print("You earned 5 points")
# if alien_color == "purple":
#     pass


# Choose a color for an alien as you did in Exercise 3, and write an if-else chain.
# •	If the alien’s color is green, print a statement that the player just earned 5 points for shooting the alien.
# •	If the alien’s color isn’t green, print a statement that the player just earned 10 points.
# •	Write one version of this program that runs the if block and another that runs the else block.


# alien_color = "green"
# alien_color = "yellow"
# alien_color = "red"
# if alien_color == "green":
#     print("You earned 5 points for shooting the alien")
# if alien_color != "green":
#     print("You just earned 10 points")


# Write an if-elif-else chain that determines a person’s stage of life. Set a value for the variable age, and then:
# •	If the person is less than 2 years old, print a message that the person is a baby.
# •	If the person is at least 2 years old but less than 4, print a message that the person is a toddler.
# •	If the person is at least 4 years old but less than 13, print a message that the person is a kid.
# •	If the person is at least 13 years old but less than 20, print a message that the person is a teenager.
# •	If the person is at least 20 years old but less than 65, print a message that the person is an adult.
# •	If the person is age 65 or older, print a message that the person is an elder

# person = int(input("Enter Your Age"))
# if person <= 2:
#     print("The person is a baby")
